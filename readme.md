## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important information

This prototype is only fragment of the desired application and therefore many functions does not work as we would like to. However, this prototype can be seen as a simple feature demo that can provide basic idea of the project that we wanted to achieve. For future development would be needed to find out the way how to store textual data like psalms, commentaries and glosses in a meaningfull way. Because the way how to store data was not explored by this project, because it was not our goal and all texts are almost hard-coded into the application.
